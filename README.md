**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm**

* Simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm for classification problems.

**Python Implementation**

* This example uses Euclidean distance as a metric for distance calculation.
* Compares a custom implementation with scikit-learn's KNN model.
* Achieves an accuracy of 0.93 on a toy dataset (predicting customer purchase).

**Key Takeaways**

* Custom implementations can be educational, but using existing libraries like scikit-learn is generally more efficient and practical.
